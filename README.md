# Network Simulation

## Objective

Simulating a wide range of network devices, including routers, switches, hubs, servers, and endpoints, as well as various network protocols such as TCP/IP, OSPF, EIGRP, BGP, and more. This activity utilizes Cisco Packet Tracer, which is a comprehensive network simulation tool developed by Cisco Systems, designed to help users design, build, configure, and troubleshoot virtual networks in a safe and controlled environment.

### Skills Learned

Using Cisco Packet Tracer, you can acquire and practice a wide range of networking skills, including:
- Network Design and Configuration
- Routing and Switching Protocols
- Network Troubleshooting
- Wireless Networking
- Network Security
- Application Layer Protocols in terms of network traffic simulation
- VLAN and Network Segmentation
- Explore SDN controllers and IoT networks
